Kidney Excretory System Dissection GCSE A Level Biology NEET Practical Skills,"This 3D animation was designed to share life-saving information with the general public to demonstrate the importance of good, effective CPR! 

Effective compressions create an artificial pump and send oxygenated blood to the brain to keep the brain alive. CPR also keeps blood and oxygen moving through the heart muscle itself so that it has the best chance of being successfully defibrillated when the AED arrives. 

After a Sudden Cardiac Arrest, brain damage will start to set in within 4 minutes and is irreversible after 10 minutes. CPR is the person�s only chance of survival while waiting for an automated external defibrillator to arrive. 

Action First Aid is committed to widespread access, awareness and public education about when and how to use an AED and perform effective CPR. Please share this video with all of your loved ones and friends as together we truly have the power to save more lives!
